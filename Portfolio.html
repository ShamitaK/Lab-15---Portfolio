                <h1>Aquarium Cycling</h1>
                <h2>Important to do before adding fish</h2>
                    <p>
                        Nature’s way of recycling nutrients is known as the NITROGEN CYCLE. At a very high level, bacteria and plants 
                        convert and consume nitrogen compounds from their environment, animals eat the plants and bacteria, and then 
                        the plants and bacteria consume the animal’s waste as their food.<br>
                        <br>
                        In an aquarium, the same thing happens. You feed your fish, your fish produces waste (also known as ammonia), 
                        and then bacteria and plants absorb the toxic waste so that the water is safer for your fish to live in. But 
                        wait! What happens if you’ve just set up a new aquarium with tap water, gravel, and decorations? Where are the 
                        plants and beneficial bacteria that can break down the fish waste? That’s why we need AQUARIUM CYCLING: the process 
                        of making sure that your fish tank’s ecosystem can process ammonia without killing any animals.

                <h1>Acclimation</h1>
                <h3>Floating Bag Method:</h3>
                    <p>
                        After you leave the fish store you will want to go straight home to avoid ammonia accumulating in the bag (in the form 
                        of fish waste). Once you get home, open the top of the bag and remove about 25% of the water from the bag. Replace this 
                        water with the same amount of water from your tank. Float the bag in your tank and bring down the hood opening on the open 
                        end of the bag to help keep the bag secure. Every 10 minutes add about 1 measuring cup (use less if the bag is smaller) of 
                        your tank water to the bag. Repeat this process for about an hour. After an hour has passed use a small net to get the fish 
                        out of the bag and gently place the fish into your tank. The main idea here is to slowly get the fish used to your tank water 
                        (acclimated). Do not dump the bag water into your tank! If you do, you risk exposing your tank to any parasites or diseases 
                        that were in the dealer's tanks

                <h3>Drip Method:</h3>
                    <p>
                <img class="imgRight" src="https://www.melevsreef.com/sites/default/files/drip-acclimation.jpg" alt="fishcare1" height="300">

                        The drip acclimation method is recommended for most saltwater fish and invertebrates because they can be more sensitive to pH,
                        specific gravity and other water chemistry changes.<br>
                        <br>
                        Place one end of the tube into the veggie clip and then place the veggie clip into your tank. Tie a knot in the tubing to 
                        regulate the amount of water flow coming out of your tank. Get the siphon going and place the other end of the tubing into 
                        the bag in the bucket. You'll want a slow drip, drip, drip going. Aim for drips every one to two seconds. If you're having 
                        troubles using the knot to regulate the drip rate, any type of strong clip should work. Vice-grips (locking pliers) or c-clamps 
                        would work as well.<br> 
                        <br>How long you do the drip method depends on what your acclimating to your fish tank. If your doing this 
                        method for most freshwater species you should be ok doing it for an hour or so before introducing the fish to your tank. If 
                        you're doing this method on a saltwater invertebrate you may want to take 2 or 3 hours for this acclimation procedure. If you 
                        have a good pet shop and you trust their advice, ask for and follow their recommendations on the amount of time needed for 
                        acclimation.
