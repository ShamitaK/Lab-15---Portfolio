            <h1>My Hobby</h1>
            <p>I have recently got involved in the fish hobby. I currently have one 55-gallon tank with 4 goldfish and a
                5-gallon tank with a betta fish. My future goals in this hobby include exploring more advanced level
                fish care, adding more tanks, and learning how to effectively aquascape. Aquascaping is the craft of
                arranging aquatic plants, as well as rocks, stones, cavework, or driftwood, in an aesthetically pleasing
                manner within an aquariumâ€”in effect, gardening underwater.</p>

            <h1>Goldfish</h1>
            <p>The goldfish (Carassius auratus) is a freshwater fish in the family Cyprinidae of order Cypriniformes. 
                It is one of the most commonly kept aquarium fish. A relatively small member of the carp family (which 
                also includes the Prussian carp and the crucian carp), the goldfish is native to East Asia. It was first 
                selectively bred in ancient China more than 1,000 years ago, and several distinct breeds have since been 
                developed. Goldfish breeds vary greatly in size, body shape, fin configuration and coloration (various 
                combinations of white, yellow, orange, red, brown, and black are known).</p>

            <h1>Arowana</h1>
            <p>Arowanas are freshwater bony fish of the family Osteoglossidae, 
                also known as bonytongues (the latter name is now often reserved for Arapaimidae).
                In this family of fish, the head is bony and the elongated body is covered by large, 
                heavy scales, with a mosaic pattern of canals. The dorsal and anal fins have soft rays 
                nd are long based, while the pectoral and ventral fins are small. The name "bonytongues" 
                is derived from a toothed bone on the floor of the mouth, the "tongue", equipped with 
                teeth that bite against teeth on the roof of the mouth. The arowana is a facultative air 
                breather and can obtain oxygen from air by sucking it into its swim bladder, which is lined 
                with capillaries like lung tissue.</p>

            <h1>Flowerhorn</h1>
            <p>Flowerhorn cichlids are ornamental aquarium fish noted for their vivid colors and the distinctively shaped heads for which they are named. Their head protuberance, or kok, is formally termed a nuchal hump. Like blood parrot cichlids, they are man-made hybrids that exist in the wild only because of their release. First developed in Malaysia, Thailand, and Taiwan, they became very popular with Asian fish hobbyists. They are also kept by hobbyists in the US and Europe. Numerous cast-off flowerhorns have been released to the wild, especially in Singapore and Malaysia, where they have become an invasive pest animal. Their importation is banned in Australia.</p>
