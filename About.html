        <h1>My Bio</h1>
            <p>.NET developer with a background in sales and group communication. Competitive by nature, I lead my own
                technical advancement with a growth mindset and belief that anything can be learned. Before diving into
                an intense back-end coding bootcamp, I worked at Quicken Loans and earned a variety of awards. One of them includes 
                MVP award. I believe that when you follow your passions, work hard, and keep setting goals anything is possible. 
                With a bachelor’s in psychology, I am eager to apply my understanding of others to web development and continue 
                expanding my knowledge of object oriented programming.<br>
                <br>

                I am passionate about many things and love to keep setting goal. My future goals in this hobby learn how to aquascape and begin
                adding more tanks as well as learn more of all types of fish.

        <h1>What is aquascaping?</h1>

        <p>Aquascaping is the craft of arranging aquatic plants, as well as rocks, stones, cavework, 
            or driftwood, in an aesthetically pleasing manner within an aquarium—in effect, gardening 
            under water. Aquascape designs include a number of distinct styles, including the garden-like 
            Dutch style and the Japanese-inspired nature style.Typically, an aquascape houses fish as well as plants, 
            although it is possible to create an aquascape with plants only, or with rockwork or other hardscape 
            and no plants. Although the primary aim of aquascaping is to create an artful underwater landscape, 
            the technical aspects of tank maintenance and the growth requirements of aquatic plants are also taken into 
            consideration. Many factors must be balanced in the closed system of an aquarium tank to ensure the success 
            of an aquascape. These factors include filtration, maintaining carbon dioxide at levels sufficient to 
            support photosynthesis underwater, substrate and fertilization, lighting, and algae control.Aquascape hobbyists 
            trade plants, conduct contests, and share photographs and information via the Internet.The United States-based Aquatic 
            Gardeners Association has about 1,200 members.</p>

        <h1>Things To Know</h1>
        <p>Before we jump in and explore aquascaping there needs to be a functioning aquarium environment. Aquascaping setups 
            can differ significantly from standard tropical setups. This is because some aquatic plants require higher lighting 
            and nutrient rich substrates to thrive. Each link below walks through an important parameter to consider when setting 
            up your aquascape. Low maintenance aquascapes have since become popular in the hobby. These utilize minimal CO2, less 
            fertilizer supplementation and low wattage lighting. Lower lighting setups can be just as stunning but are limited to 
            a smaller variety of plants. These usually include ferns, moss, crypts and anubias.</p>

            <h2>Start with easy plants like Java Fern, Anubias, or Amazon Swords since they are more hardier.</h2>
